        "1. What is a RESTful API\n",
        "  - A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is a type of web API that follows REST principles.\n",
        "  - It allows clients to interact with server resources using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.\n",
        "  - Each resource is identified by a URL, and operations are stateless.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of API specification\n",
        "  - An API specification is a detailed document that defines how an API works.\n",
        "  - It includes endpoints, request/response formats, authentication mechanisms, and error codes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is Flask, and why is it popular for building APIs\n",
        "  - Flask is a micro web framework in Python used to build web apps and APIs.\n",
        "  - It is popular due to its simplicity, minimalism, and flexibility.\n",
        "  - It requires little boilerplate code and allows quick setup for REST APIs using tools like Flask-RESTful.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is routing in Flask\n",
        "  - Routing in Flask refers to mapping URLs to Python functions.\n",
        "  - This is done using the @app.route() decorator.\n",
        "  - When a specific URL is accessed, Flask executes the function associated with that route.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. How do you create a simple Flask application\n",
        "        from flask import Flask\n",
        "        app = Flask(__name__)\n",
        "\n",
        "        @app.route('/')\n",
        "        def home():\n",
        "            return 'Hello, World!'\n",
        "\n",
        "  To run this locally:\n",
        "          app.run(debug=True)\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What are HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs\n",
        "  - RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods:\n",
        "    - GET: Retrieve data\n",
        "    - POST: Create new data\n",
        "    - PUT: Update existing data\n",
        "    - DELETE: Remove data\n",
        "    - PATCH: Partially update data\n",
        "    - OPTIONS: Describe communication options\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the purpose of the @app.route() decorator in Flask\n",
        "  - The @app.route() decorator is used to define URL routes in Flask.\n",
        "  - It tells Flask which function to call when a specific URL is accessed.\n",
        "  - It also allows specifying allowed HTTP methods for that route.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the difference between GET and POST HTTP methods\n",
        "  - GET is used to request data from the server. Parameters are passed in the URL.\n",
        "  - POST is used to send data to the server, typically for creation. Data is sent in the request body.\n",
        "  GET is visible in the URL and is idempotent; POST is not.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. How do you handle errors in Flask APIs\n",
        "        from flask import jsonify\n",
        "\n",
        "        @app.errorhandler(404)\n",
        "        def not_found(e):\n",
        "            return jsonify({'error': 'Resource not found'}), 404\n",
        "\n",
        "  You can define handlers for other errors like 500 (Internal Server Error) similarly.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. How do you connect Flask to a SQL database\n",
        "        from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\n",
        "\n",
        "        app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///data.db'\n",
        "        db = SQLAlchemy(app)\n",
        "\n",
        "  This sets up SQLAlchemy to use a SQLite database. Other databases can be configured similarly.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the role of Flask-SQLAlchemy\n",
        "  - Flask-SQLAlchemy is an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) extension for Flask.\n",
        "  - It allows to define Python classes as database models and interact with the database using Python code.\n",
        "  - It simplifies querying, updating, and managing databases.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are Flask blueprints, and how are they useful\n",
        "  - Blueprints are a way to organize Flask apps into reusable components or modules.\n",
        "  - They allow to define routes and views in separate files and register them in the main app.\n",
        "  - This is especially useful for large applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the purpose of Flask's request object\n",
        "        from flask import request\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The request object provides access to incoming request data like:\n",
        "      - request.form (form data)\n",
        "      - request.args (query parameters)\n",
        "      - request.json (JSON body)\n",
        "      - request.headers (request headers)\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How do you create a RESTful API endpoint using Flask\n",
        "        from flask import jsonify\n",
        "\n",
        "        @app.route('/api/data', methods=['GET'])\n",
        "        def get_data():\n",
        "            return jsonify({'message': 'This is a REST API endpoint'})\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is the purpose of Flask's jsonify() function\n",
        "  - jsonify() converts Python dictionaries/lists to a JSON response.\n",
        "  - It also sets the appropriate Content-Type header as application/json.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. Explain Flask’s url_for() function\n",
        "        from flask import url_for\n",
        "\n",
        "  - url_for() dynamically generates URLs for routes using the function name.\n",
        "  - Useful for avoiding hardcoded URLs and enabling easier refactoring.\n",
        "  - Example: url_for('home') returns '/'\n",
        "\n",
        "17. How does Flask handle static files (CSS, JavaScript, etc.)\n",
        "  - Flask automatically serves files placed in the /static folder.\n",
        "  - It can be accessed using /static/filename.ext\n",
        "  - Example:\n",
        "          <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/static/style.css\">\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is an API specification, and how does it help in building a Flask API\n",
        "  - An API specification defines how an API behaves: available endpoints, parameters, responses, and error codes.\n",
        "  - It helps in consistent development and enables automated testing, documentation, and client generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What are HTTP status codes, and why are they important in a Flask API\n",
        "  - HTTP status codes are returned with every API response to indicate the result:\n",
        "      - 200: OK\n",
        "      - 201: Created\n",
        "      - 400: Bad Request\n",
        "      - 401: Unauthorized\n",
        "      - 404: Not Found\n",
        "      - 500: Server Error\n",
        "  - They help understand the result of request.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. How do you handle POST requests in Flask\n",
        "        @app.route('/submit', methods=['POST'])\n",
        "        def submit():\n",
        "            data = request.json  # Or request.form if using form data\n",
        "            return jsonify({'received': data})\n",
        "\n",
        "21. How would you secure a Flask API\n",
        "  - Common security practices:\n",
        "      - Use HTTPS\n",
        "      - Validate and sanitize input\n",
        "      - Use authentication (e.g., API keys, OAuth, JWT)\n",
        "      - Enable CORS carefully\n",
        "      - Implement rate limiting and error handling\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the significance of the Flask-RESTful extension\n",
        "  - Flask-RESTful simplifies API development using class-based views.\n",
        "  - It allows easy definition of REST resources, method handling, and automatic request parsing.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What is the role of Flask’s session object?\n",
        "        from flask import session\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Flask’s session object stores user data between requests using secure cookies.\n",
        "  - Example: session['username'] = 'admin'\n",
        "  - Useful for login/session management.\n"
